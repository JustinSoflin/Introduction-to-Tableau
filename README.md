# Airbnb Revenue Optimization with Tableau
In this project, I explore how to identify the best times and locations for maximizing Airbnb rental income. The objective is to provide actionable insights for hosts seeking to increase profitability.

**Beginning:** the client has raw Airbnb listing and booking data but no clear understanding of seasonal patterns, geographic trends, or pricing opportunities.

**Completion:** an interactive Tableau dashboard highlights key metrics such as revenue by neighborhood, seasonal demand fluctuations, and average nightly rates, giving the client a data-driven view of when and where to maximize earnings.

## ðŸ“Š Tools Utilized

`Tableau Public:` _data visualization and interactive dashboarding_

`Public Airbnb Dataset:` _sample dataset available_ HERE

<br>

## Step 1) Preparing the Data
The analysis starts with an inner join of the Listings dataset and the Calendar dataset to combine property details with availability and pricing information.

<br>

## Step 2: Neighborhood Pricing Trends
Starting with the first worksheet, I pair Zip Code (columns) with Price (rows), adjusting the aggregation to average price instead of total sum. After changing the bar chart to be color coded, this highlights the neighborhoods where potential hosts can expect the highest returns.

<br>

## Step 3: Geographic Revenue Visualization
Using the generated latitude and longitude data, I build a filled map to provide a geographic view of average earnings. This visualization allows potential hosts to quickly identify which areas are most profitable at a glance.

<br>

## Step 4: Seasonal Pricing Trends
On the next worksheet, I graph average price by week to uncover seasonal patterns in rental demand. This view highlights the best times of year for hosts to list their properties at higher rates. As expected, profitability peaks during popular travel periods such as summer and the holidaysâ€”this visualization provides clear evidence of those trends.

## Step 5: Average Price per Bedroom
The final worksheet presents a bar chart of average price segmented by number of bedrooms. As expected, listings with more bedrooms command higher prices. To ensure accuracy, entries with null or zero bedrooms are excluded from the analysis.<Br>

<br>

## Step 6: Dashboard Assembly
All five worksheets are combined into a single interactive dashboard for streamlined analysis and quick insights. This consolidated view equips hosts with actionable data to make informed decisions. It is expected that clients may have follow-up questions or requests for additional information, which can be addressed as part of ongoing support.
